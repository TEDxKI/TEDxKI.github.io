            TEDxKI was founded in 2020, to share ideas change everything and inspire the local community even in the middle of the pandemic. This year, as we are gradually getting how to cope with these new standards, we aim to organize and carry out the second TEDxKI to inspire society and provide new alternatives on how to keep hope alive and make dreams a reality - especially during hard times. We are an international team of curious and passionate humans who work together to find the most exciting and original ideas that transcend limitations, classifications, and boundaries to create a society we all want to live in.

          <p>
            In the spirit of ideas change everything, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)
